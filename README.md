## About The Project
This repository contains the R code used to generate a gif animation showcased in a fundraising presentation for ovarian cancer research. The purpose of the animation is to captivate audiences with the remarkable capabilities of genomics sequencing technology. The animation is crafted using [gganimate](https://gganimate.com/) and comprises a series of ggplots. The tissue and projections are derived from 10X Visium spatial transcriptome data obtained from an actual endometrium sample, which serves as the basis for the animation

## The meaning of the image
Subsequently, the insights gained from this analysis are visually represented by colored dots on the t-SNE plot. These dots are then remapped to the tissue and the uterus, creating a dynamic and informative representation of the genomic journey.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How to run it
If you wish to reproduce this gif, you can [use ```renv.lock```file ](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#collaboration) to install the required R packages.
